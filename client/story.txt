Title: The Beast of Velgarth

Chapter 1: The Contract
The day was bleak when Geralt of Rivia rode into the village of Velgarth. The sky hung heavy with gray clouds, threatening rain, and the wind whipped through the narrow streets, carrying the faint scent of fear. As always, he drew stares – some in awe of the White Wolf, others in quiet disdain. His dual swords, silver and steel, clinked against his back as he dismounted at the village inn.

Inside, the inn was dimly lit by a hearth in the corner. The locals murmured softly over their mugs, their eyes following Geralt as he approached the innkeeper, a burly man with a grizzled beard.

“I’m here for the contract,” Geralt said, his voice a low rumble.

The innkeeper nodded, his face pale. "The beast has claimed five of us now. All dead, torn to shreds in the forest just west of the village. You’ll speak to the alderman for details. Gods know, we need your kind."

Geralt sat at a table, motioning for a drink. As he waited, a young woman approached him. She was dressed plainly, but her dark eyes gleamed with urgency.

“Witcher,” she said softly, “I beg of you, when you find the beast, show it no mercy.”

Geralt looked up, his expression impassive. “I don’t show mercy to monsters.”

Her lips quivered as she turned away, whispering, “It’s not just any monster.”

Chapter 2: Into the Woods
After meeting with the alderman, Geralt learned the specifics. The creature had been haunting the woods for weeks, attacking without warning, leaving mangled bodies behind. Some said it was a fiend; others whispered of a cursed nobleman turned beast. But one thing was clear: the villagers were terrified.

As night fell, Geralt ventured into the forest. The trees loomed tall and twisted, their branches like skeletal fingers reaching into the sky. His senses sharpened, his Witcher mutations allowing him to see in the dark, to hear the faintest of sounds.

The wind rustled the leaves, and the air was thick with the scent of rotting foliage. Geralt unsheathed his silver sword, the weapon of choice against supernatural foes. He moved with practiced precision, each step measured, listening for signs of the creature.

Then he heard it—a low growl, distant but unmistakable. The sound of something large, something hungry.

Geralt crouched low, scanning the darkness. His hand instinctively reached for a potion. He drank it in a swift gulp, feeling the familiar burn of the decoction heightening his reflexes. He pressed onward, following the trail of broken branches and heavy footprints in the soil.

Suddenly, a shadow darted between the trees. A massive shape, too fast to make out clearly. Geralt’s muscles tensed as he prepared for the attack.

Chapter 3: The Hunt Begins
The beast charged from the shadows, a hulking mass of muscle and fur, its eyes glowing red with unnatural fury. It resembled a fiend, but there was something strange about it—its movements, too agile, too deliberate for a mere animal.

Geralt leapt to the side, narrowly avoiding the creature’s sharp claws. He spun, slashing at the beast with his silver sword. The blade bit into its flesh, but it only enraged the monster further. It howled in pain and lunged again, its jaws snapping inches from Geralt’s throat.

This was no ordinary fiend.

Dodging swiftly, Geralt cast a protective Quen sign, a shimmering shield enveloping his body just as the beast swiped at him. The impact sent him stumbling back, but the shield held, absorbing most of the blow.

The beast circled him, snarling, its breath ragged. In the flickering light of the moon, Geralt saw it more clearly—its fur was mottled with patches of human skin, as though it had once been a man.

“You’re cursed,” Geralt muttered under his breath.

The creature growled in response, but there was a glimmer of recognition in its eyes.

Chapter 4: A Cursed Soul
After a grueling fight, Geralt managed to drive the beast off, but not before wounding it deeply. Blood stained the ground where the creature fled, and Geralt followed the trail, deeper into the woods, until he came upon a small clearing.

There, in the middle of the clearing, was a crumbling stone altar. Ancient runes were carved into its surface, glowing faintly in the moonlight. Kneeling before it, to Geralt's surprise, was the same young woman from the inn.

She didn’t turn as he approached, her eyes locked on the altar.

“So it’s true,” Geralt said, his voice calm. “The beast… it's someone you know, isn’t it?”

She nodded slowly, tears streaming down her cheeks. “My brother. He was cursed by an old sorcerer after a quarrel over land. I… I thought I could save him. But every night, he changes. Every night, he becomes that monster.”

Geralt's eyes narrowed as he surveyed the scene. He had encountered curses before, but this one was tied to something darker—ancient magic. Magic that could only be undone through blood.

"You know what must be done," Geralt said, his voice steady but grim.

Chapter 5: The Final Confrontation
As dawn neared, Geralt prepared for the final confrontation. The young woman, though heartbroken, knew there was no saving her brother. She had led him to this cursed fate, and now only death would release him from the monstrous form he took each night.

Geralt tracked the beast back to its lair. Inside the dark cave, the stench of decay was overpowering. Bones littered the ground, remnants of the beast’s past victims.

The creature lay in the corner, its breath ragged, weakened from the wounds Geralt had inflicted. But it was still dangerous.

This time, Geralt didn’t hesitate. He drew his silver sword, the runes along the blade glowing faintly in the darkness. The beast stirred, sensing his presence. With a roar, it lunged, but Geralt was faster.

With a swift, practiced motion, he drove the sword deep into the beast's chest. The creature let out one final, agonized cry before collapsing to the ground, its body convulsing as the curse lifted. The fur melted away, revealing the body of a man beneath—a man who looked at Geralt with sad, human eyes as he died.

Epilogue
The village of Velgarth was quiet when Geralt returned. The people, though relieved, still looked at him with a mixture of fear and respect. The young woman had vanished into the woods, too burdened by guilt to face what she had wrought.

Geralt collected his reward in silence, knowing that in the end, there were no true victories in his line of work. Only death, curses, and the occasional fleeting moment of peace.

As he mounted Roach and rode away from the village, the first rays of sunlight broke through the clouds. But for Geralt of Rivia, the road ahead would always be shrouded in shadow.
